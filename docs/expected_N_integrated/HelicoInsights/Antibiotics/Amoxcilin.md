# Amoxicillin Pharmacokinetic Profile

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Distribution Rate (K12) | 1.77/h | From IV studies |
| Transfer Rate (K21) | 1.91/h | From IV studies |
| Elimination Rate (Ke) | 1.98/h | From IV studies |
| Central Volume (V1) | 0.20 L/kg | Plasma compartment |
| Total Volume (Vd) | 0.41 L/kg | All compartments |
| Systemic Clearance | 0.32 L/kg/h | Dose-independent |

## Route-Specific Parameters
| Parameter | Oral | Intramuscular | Intravenous |
|-----------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Bioavailability | 93% | 92% | 100% |
| Absorption Rate (Ka) | 0.7-1.3/h* | 0.7-1.3/h* | N/A |
| Time to Peak | 1.25h | 1.16h | N/A |
| Absorption Delay | 0.35h | 0.19h | N/A |
| Urinary Recovery | 48.5% | 51.3% | 56.4% |

*Dose-dependent: higher doses show slower absorption rates

## Global Resistance Patterns
| Region | Resistance Rate (%) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Africa | 72.6 |
| Americas | 10.0-23.0 |
| Eastern Mediterranean | 33.0 |
| Europe | 0.4-18.0 |
| Southeast Asia | 10.0 |
| Western Pacific | 34.0 |

## Clinical Considerations
- Dose-dependent absorption: Higher doses show proportionally lower peak levels
- Complete and reliable absorption via both oral and IM routes
- Peak serum concentrations decrease with increasing dose:
  - 250mg: ~15 μg/mL
  - 500mg: ~11 μg/mL
  - 1000mg: ~9.5 μg/mL

## Resistance Implications
- Wide variation in resistance rates globally (0.4-72.6%)
- Higher resistance rates in Africa and Western Pacific regions
- Lower resistance rates in Europe and Americas
- Consider local resistance patterns when selecting therapy

## Pharmacokinetic Terms and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Ka | Absorption rate constant - rate at which drug enters systemic circulation |
| Ke | Elimination rate constant - rate at which drug is removed from system |
| K12 | Transfer rate constant from central to peripheral compartment |
| K21 | Transfer rate constant from peripheral to central compartment |
| V1 | Volume of central (plasma) compartment |
| Vd | Volume of distribution - theoretical volume needed to contain total drug at same concentration as plasma |
| AUC | Area under the curve - measure of total drug exposure over time |
| Bioavailability | Fraction of administered dose that reaches systemic circulation |
| t½ | Half-life - time required for concentration to decrease by 50% |
| Clearance | Volume of plasma cleared of drug per unit time |
| IM | Intramuscular administration |
| IV | Intravenous administration |

# CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS AND SAFETY ANALYSIS

## Table 5: Safety Profile Summary

| Severity Rating | All Mild | All Mild |
| Causality | Probably/Possibly Related | Probably/Possibly Related |

## Clinical Considerations

### 1. Therapeutic Applications
- Multiple-dose regimen (500 mg q12h) well-tolerated in both age groups
- No dose adjustment required solely based on age
- Broad antimicrobial spectrum maintained across age groups

### 2. Age-Related Changes
a) Pharmacokinetic Impact:
   - Reduced renal clearance in elderly
   - Increased drug exposure (AUC, Cmax, Cmin)
   - Extended half-life for both parent and metabolite

b) Physiological Factors:
   - Decreased creatinine clearance (CrCl) in elderly
   - No significant impact on drug absorption
   - Maintained distribution volume despite age-related body composition changes

### 3. Safety Considerations
- Higher drug exposure in elderly well-tolerated
- No increase in adverse event frequency or severity
- Different adverse event profile between age groups
- Digestive system events more common in young subjects (p < 0.05)

### 4. Monitoring Requirements
- Baseline renal function assessment recommended
- No special monitoring required based on age alone
- Standard adverse event monitoring sufficient

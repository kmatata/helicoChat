# Clarithromycin Pharmacokinetic Profile

## Basic Properties
| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Chemical Class | Macrolide antibiotic | 14-membered ring structure |
| Molecular Weight | 747.95 g/mol | Semi-synthetic derivative |
| Active Metabolite | 14(R)-hydroxyclarithromycin | ~25% potency of parent |
| Protein Binding | 65-70% | Concentration independent |

## Comparative Formulation Parameters
| Parameter | Extended-Release (ER) | Immediate-Release (IR) |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Daily Dose | 1000 mg once daily | 500 mg twice daily |
| Peak Concentration (Cmax) | 2.59 mg/L | 3.51 mg/L |
| Time to Peak (Tmax) | 7.8 h | 2.1 h |
| Trough Level (Cmin) | 0.76 mg/L | 0.91 mg/L |
| 24h Exposure (AUC24) | 42.1 mg•h/L | 46.1 mg•h/L |
| Fluctuation Index (DFL) | 1.08 | 1.38 |

## Pharmacokinetic Parameters
| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Oral Bioavailability (F) | 50% | Food increases by 25% |
| Volume of Distribution (Vd) | 200-400 L | Extensive tissue distribution |
| Total Body Clearance (CL) | 30-33 L/h | Reduced in hepatic impairment |
| Renal Clearance (CLr) | 7-12 L/h | ~20-30% of total clearance |
| Elimination Half-life (t½) | 5-7 h | Increased in elderly |
| Metabolic Pathway | CYP3A4 | Primary hepatic route |


## Clinical Considerations
- Food Effects:
  - ER bioavailability ↓30% under fasting conditions
  - Should be administered with meals
- Special Populations:
  - Elderly: 30-50% increase in half-life
  - Hepatic impairment: Dose reduction needed
  - Renal impairment: Adjust if CrCl <30 mL/min

## Tolerability Comparison (ER vs IR)
| Adverse Event | ER (%) | IR (%) |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Treatment-related AEs | 25.1 | 20.7 |
| GI Events | Lower severity* | Higher severity |
| Discontinuation Rate | 0.7 | 2.9 |
*Statistically significant difference (p=0.018)
